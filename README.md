# üß† Synchronous FIFO Verification Project

## üìò Overview

This repository contains the design and verification environment for a **Synchronous FIFO (First-In-First-Out)** implemented in SystemVerilog.  
The project includes:
- FIFO RTL design
- Verification environment
- Functional coverage
- Assertions
- Simulation setup files

The testbench follows an **object-oriented methodology** focused on achieving 100% code, functional, and assertion coverage.

## üß© Verification Environment

### üîπ Top Module
- Generates the clock and reset.
- Passes the interface handle to DUT, testbench, and monitor.
- Ends simulation when `test_finished` signal is asserted.

### üîπ Monitor
- Creates and manages objects of:
  - `FIFO_transaction`
  - `FIFO_scoreboard`
  - `FIFO_coverage`
- Samples the interface signals every clock cycle.
- Calls coverage and checking methods.
- Stops simulation and reports summary statistics at the end.

## üß± Class Architecture

### 1. `FIFO_transaction`
- Holds FIFO inputs and outputs as class members.
- Includes configurable randomization distributions:
  - `RD_EN_ON_DIST` (default: 30)
  - `WR_EN_ON_DIST` (default: 70)
- Defines constraints for:
  - Rare reset assertions
  - Read/Write enable signal distributions

### 2. `FIFO_coverage`
- Imports `FIFO_transaction` package.
- Defines a covergroup to perform cross coverage between:
  - `wr_en`, `rd_en`, and each control output (`full`, `empty`, `almostfull`, `almostempty`, etc.)
- Ensures all FIFO operational states are exercised.
- Contains a `sample_data()` method for sampling coverage.

### 3. `FIFO_scoreboard`
- Imports `FIFO_transaction` package.
- Implements a reference model for FIFO functionality.
- Compares DUT outputs against expected reference results.
- Increments `correct_count` and `error_count` accordingly.
- Displays mismatch messages for debugging.

---

## üßæ Assertions

- Assertions are embedded in the FIFO RTL file and guarded using conditional compilation.

---

## üìà Coverage Goals

- **100% code coverage**
- **100% functional coverage**
- **100% assertion coverage**
